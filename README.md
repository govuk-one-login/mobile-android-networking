## Updating gradle-wrapper

Gradle secure hash algorithm (SHA) pinning is in place through the `distributionSha256Sum` attribute in gradle-wrapper.properties. This means the gradle-wrapper must upgrade through the `./gradlew wrapper` command.
Example gradle-wrapper.properties
```
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
distributionSha256Sum=2db75c40782f5e8ba1fc278a5574bab070adccb2d21ca5a6e5ed840888448046
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.10.2-bin.zip
networkTimeout=10000
validateDistributionUrl=true
 ```

Use the following command to update the gradle wrapper. Run the same command twice, [reason](https://sp4ghetticode.medium.com/the-elephant-in-the-room-how-to-update-gradle-in-your-android-project-correctly-09154fe3d47b).

```bash
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=8.10.2 --distribution-type=bin --gradle-distribution-sha256-sum=31c55713e40233a8303827ceb42ca48a47267a0ad4bab9177123121e71524c26
```

Flags:
- `gradle-version` self explanatory
- `distribution-type` set to `bin` short for binary refers to the gradle bin, often in this format `gradle-8.10.2-bin.zip`
- `gradle-distribution-sha256-sum` the SHA 256 checksum from this [page](https://gradle.org/release-checksums/), pick the binary checksum for the version used

The gradle wrapper update can include:
- gradle-wrapper.jar
- gradle-wrapper.properties
- gradlew
- gradlew.bat

You can use the following command to check the SHA 256 checksum of a file

```bash
shasum -a 256 gradle-8.10.2-bin.zip
```

## Hotfix changes
There are GitHub Actions workflows for a hotfix pull request and merging a hotfix to a temporary
hotfix branch.

The temporary hotfix branch is currently expected to be named "temp/hotfix". If a different name is
desired please edit the value under "branches:" in `.github/workflows/on_push_hotfix.yml`.
The hotfix branch name should be in the format "hotfix/M.m.p".

Once the hotfix PR has been approved and the "Squash and merge" button pressed, the merge title
must be in the format "Merge pull request #xxx from govuk-one-login/release/M.m.p" to allow for the
correct version to be extracted and used as a tag.
